# Metrics

By default, metrics are disabled and there is no metrics server.

You can however enable metrics reporting as described below.

## [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/)

To enable Prometheus metrics reporting, set `METRICS_TYPE=prometheus`.

The metrics will be reported by an HTTP server on port `9090`.

üíÅ You can change that with `METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ADDRESS=":9090"`.

If you have Prometheus running in a container in the same network as this DNS container (named `dns`), you can configure Prometheus to get the metrics data by adding

```yml
- job_name: 'dns'
  static_configs:
    - targets: ['dns:9090']
```

in your `scrape_configs:` block in your `prometheus.yml` configuration file.

### [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/)

To visualize metrics, I recommend using Grafana.

You can import the dashboard I designed with the following steps:

1. In your Grafana web user interface, click on the import button:

    ![Import step one](grafana-import-step-1.jpg)

1. Copy the JSON code from [grafana.json](grafana.json)
1. Paste the code in the panel JSON and click **Load**:

### Metrics available

All the metrics exported will have the `dns_` prefix.

üíÅ You can change that with `METRICS_PROMETHEUS_SUBSYSTEM=dns`.

The list of all metrics available is as follows:
